# Hexapod_single_axis_scan_with_Pilatus_C_sharp_console
This C# console program scans with single axis of the hexapod and for each step it takes image with Pilatus detector.

This C# console program first asks for IP address of the hexapod, for example 147.213.112.19. Then, it asks for operating port of the hexapod, for example 50000. In the line 26, the session with hexapod is opened using TCPClient. The network stream with the hexapod is get in the line 27. Then, the console application asks for scanning axis. It can be X, Y, Z, U, V, W. The console application then asks for the initial abolute position of the hexapod axis, the final absolute position of the hexapod axis and relative step of the hexapod axis. The console application gives you possibility to set an idle time, during which the hexapod moves to the initial position. It can be for example 60 seconds. The console application gives you possibility to set an idle time, during which the hecxapod performs relative movement. It can be for example 1 second. Then, the console application asks for the IP addres of the Pilatus detector, for example 147.213.112.21. It asks for the port of the camserver of the Pilatus detector, for example 41234. Finally, the console application allows you to set number of images you want to take, exposure time of the Pilatus detector (for example 60 seconds), exposure period of the Pilatus detector (for example 61 seconds, expsoure time + extra time 1 second) and image name (for example image). The exposure period must be value always bigger than exposure time. The image name is without extension, tif extension is added automatically. The function for taking images with Pilatus detctor is named Pilatus_exposition and is between lines 120 and 207. The session with
